Working draft of Radix Sorting Algorithm in Python. Using VS Code as the IDE, the "venv" folder is virtual environment and the file main.py contains the source code. I would appreciate any comments, or suggestions. Thank you!
The code in app.py file is a source code for a phone number analyzer in python. It works for any phone number of any country as long as you put the correct area code.
